Game Design Document: Dungeon Keeper — Middle Management

1. Game Overview

Title: Dungeon Keeper: Middle Management
Genre: Narrative Strategy RPG, Dungeon Management, Light Tactics
Playstyle: Turn-based, story-driven, “prep and defend” with resource management

Game Description:
    Players assume the role of an undead “middle manager” (a Lich or other evil creature) running a small but sinister dungeon on behalf of the faceless mega-corporation, Sinister Solutions, LLC. The player must balance prepping defenses, upgrading minions, and investing in traps with a limited evil budget, all while facing increasingly bold (and often underwhelming) heroic incursions.
    The game emphasizes narrative choice, tactical planning, and light rules focused on meaningful decisions rather than heavy dice mechanics.

2. Core Systems
    - Currency: EU (Evil Units)

        Definition: EU is the universal currency for all purchases, upgrades, services, and bribes.

        Exchange Rate: 1 EU ≈ 100 gold coins or an equivalent minor dark favor.

        Earning EU:

            Regular “base budgets” from Evil HR (quarterly or per workday).

            Performance bonuses for defeating or humiliating heroes, spreading fear, or preserving resources.

            Liquidating loot from fallen adventurers.

            Salvaging old or damaged equipment/traps for partial EU refunds.

    - Threat & Reputation Levels

        Threat Level: Indicates dungeon danger/attention; governs funding and the difficulty/quality of invading heroes.

        Reputation: Tracks notoriety or infamy among heroes and other evil organizations, affecting special events and types of challengers.

    - Dungeon Map & Room System

        Dungeon is represented as an ASCII map or room list.

        Each room may contain:

            Traps (each with a status, subtlety, and effects)

            Minions (with role assignments)

            Special features (vaults, hidden passages, phylactery location, etc.)

    - Traps & Subtlety (Tier System)

        Traps have a Tier: Low, Medium, High, Legendary.

        Subtlety Level: Dictates difficulty for heroes to detect/disarm.

        Trap vs. Hero Tier Resolution:

            If Trap Tier > Hero Tier: Hero cannot detect/avoid (except via plot/magic).

            If Hero Tier > Trap Tier: Hero always detects/avoids.

            If Equal Tier: Outcome determined by narrative, clever play, or GM discretion (player’s prep and tactics matter).

        Trap Upgrades:

            May increase tier, subtlety, or add special effects (for additional EU cost).

            Repairs & Salvage:

            Repair costs less than new traps.

            Salvaging old traps gives partial EU refund when replacing with a new trap.

    - Minions & Upgrades

        Minions:

            Have roles (frontline, ambusher, ranged, etc.), strengths, and weaknesses.

            Can be upgraded via gear, magical items, or specialized training (for EU).

            Elite squads can be trained further to shore up weaknesses or learn teamwork maneuvers.

    - Heroic Incursion & Turn-Based Encounter System

        Narrative, turn-based encounters:

        1. Player preps dungeon and minions during “prep phase.”

        2. Heroic party enters and moves room-by-room.

        Each turn:

        1. Heroes take actions (advance, search, attack, etc.).

        2. Dungeon resolves traps, minion actions, environmental effects.

        3. Player may give minion orders, trigger spells, or use emergency resources.

        4. Outcomes resolved by tier matchups, planning, and narrative logic (no heavy dice system).

        Victory Conditions: Repel heroes (e.g. force them to flee, kill them, or capture them), minimize damage, and maintain your phylactery’s safety.

    - Phylactery & Special Assets

        - Phylactery:

            The player’s “life anchor.” Must be well hidden and protected.

            Special upgrades (hidden nooks, anti-divination, traps) are available.

            Losing it results in defeat (game over or major penalty).

    - Upgrades, Customization, and Salvage

        EU is used for all upgrades (minions, traps, rooms, magical protections).

        Old/broken assets may be salvaged for partial EU when replacing with new assets.

        Customization is encouraged: custom traps, themed upgrades, or special minions/projects are available at GM’s discretion and quoted EU cost.

3. Example Game Loop

    - Prep Phase:

        Player reviews dungeon, spends EU on upgrades and positioning.

        Assigns minions, traps, and secures phylactery.

    - Incursion Phase:

        Heroic party arrives.

        Encounters resolved room-by-room, using trap/minion tier vs. hero tier, player tactics, and narrative GM adjudication.

    - Aftermath Phase:

        Surviving heroes retreat or are looted.

        Player tallies loot, gets EU bonuses, and may salvage/repair.

        Threat & reputation levels adjusted.

        Prepares for the next round.

4. Playstyle & Tone

    - Emphasis:

        Strategic resource management, creative problem-solving, and narrative consequences.

        Light, humorous tone—dungeon management with bureaucratic and workplace parody elements.    

    - Rules-Lite:

        Focus is on decision-making and narrative, not dice or heavy stats.

        Most outcomes rely on the player’s cleverness, the dungeon’s setup, and the “tier” comparison system.
